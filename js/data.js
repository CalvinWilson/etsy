Shipping DOMESTIC SHIPPING: All shipments except APO addresses, Alaska and Hawaii are sent through Fed Ex. PO Box addresses can take up to 9 days for delivery. If you are shipping to an Apartment, please make sure you check with the Apartment Manager before contacting us about a lost package. FedEx will deliver to Front Offices in most cases. ",

We make no guarantee of delivery outside of the shipping address on the invoice. In situations where an address needs to be changed, it will be required to place a new order with the correct address listed for the shipping address.

These charges MUST be paid prior to having an item re-shipped as we used the address you provided If an item is lost, we have to file a claim with FedEx in order to find the missing item. If the item shows as delivered to the address provided, we have to wait to replace the item until FedEx completes their investigation. We have to do this because all of our items are made to order, therefore, if it is found, we are out the replacement item. We realize this is frustrating, but our hands are tied in these rare situations. Claims for non-delivery must be received no later than 4 weeks from the date the item was marked as shipped. Damaged in Shipment: Please let us know as soon as possible about any damage done in shipment. Please send us any photographs of the damaged item and to the box it was delivered in. We will have Fed Ex come pick up the damaged item and packaging so we can file a claim. A replacement will be sent out as soon as possible. You are purchasing a personalized item, therefore, once the item has been engraved with your details, it is unusable to us or anyone else. Refunds or replacements will be offered for these purposes only: 1- We engraved the wrong design into your item. 2- We gave you the wrong item. If the error is on the customer it is best to contact us directly and we can try to provide a replacement at a reduced cost, or give you details on how the board can be fixed with the corrected information. We make no promise of delivery times or can control the delivery companies, therefore an expected date being missed is not a reason for a refund nor will one be given. If the item is refused at delivery by either the buyer or recipient, the is NO REFUND and will only be returned after another shipping payment made to ship the item out again. ",

We copy and paste the spellings and dates provided, so proofs for a confirmation of spelling will not be supplied. Proofs are supplied only for 1) Orders that include a design fee or 2) We have determined that the instructions on the order require clarification or approval. CUSTOM ORDERS: Custom orders are designs that are not already offered in our shop. Usually the customer provides a specific saying, image or logo they want added to their item. All requests for Custom designs MUST be approved, and an order may be voided if the approval for processing has not been secured prior to placing an order. Please request a custom item or contact us with your idea. Only when we know what you are hoping for, can we give you a price. We charge an initial flat fee of the board. Additional charges will apply depending on the time and difficulty of the order. These charges and their guidelines are listed on our design fee listing. There could also be an additional engraving charge if the request exceeds our allotted engraving time. Proofs will be automatically sent with every custom order. Custom fees are subject to change based on additional work required, revisions, and engraving time. We reserve the right to refuse any custom order due to difficulty, incorrect fees applied, or lack of communication. PROCESSING: We average between one to two business weeks processing time. The processing time frame can change. During our busiest seasons our time frame can be extended up to 3 business weeks, depending on the item and any issues with the suppliers. ",

Work or replacement items cannot begin until we have required photographs. OAK BARREL INFO: There are lots of oak barrel makers out there (with lots of different theories and practices) and there is lots of info on the Web. We suggest learning more if you have specific questions. Here are some helpful tips we found online (this is just a general summary of information and not meant to be complete): • As the barrels are a wood product, they are subject to the wood drying and shrinking. • In order for the spigot to flow freely, please remember to remove the bung/cork before you open the spigot ... pour from the spigot ... then close the spigot and finally ... replace the bung/cork. • To keep your barrels performing and looking their best, please keep them stored in a protected area away from the elements and optimally in a cool and relatively humid area. • Barrels with painted black steel hoops are particularly susceptible to moisture. A little care goes a long way. Prevent excessive staining and rust by keeping the exterior of the barrel dry. • Avoid water stains by using a funnel to carefully fill your new barrel. • Sandpaper will generally remove any stains or marks on the barrel. • As the barrels are handcrafted, liquid volume is approximate. • You should be able to reuse your barrel from 3-5 times ... remember that each aging will take longer than the previous one. • Please do not nail or put screws into the hoops or staves as doing so will compromise the oak and might cause damage. • If you want to age a different type of spirit then was initially aged in it, we recommend you use a new barrel. • For your safety, if using chemicals to clean/sanitize your barrels, please follow the manufacturer’s instructions for proper use. • The spirit can age anywhere from one week to one-year, but it&#39;s recommended that you take a small taste test every two weeks. Remember to only take a small taste to ensure the top of the barrel does not get dry to avoid leaking and losing your spirit to the &#39;Angel&#39;s Share.&#39; Once the spirit reaches your perfect taste, empty the spirit into a decanter and restart the process! Angel’s Share. Angel’s Share is a fancy name for evaporation. Since mini-barrel staves are thinner than normal distillery size 53-gallon barrel staves, there is a higher “angel’s share”, thus higher evaporation. To avoid this evaporation, make sure you follow the instructions and 1) fill the barrel to the very top when first filling the barrel with your spirit; and 2) keep the top of the barrel moist after using the barrel by rolling the liquid around every couple of days. As previously mentioned, we recommend taking very small taste-tests every two weeks to ensure much of the top of the barrel does not become dry.&quot; Storing your Empty Barrel After Initial Use Ideally, your barrel would always be filled. Used barrels require no special preparation beyond a simple water rinse, if desired, when transferring out and in immediately. If used barrels are to be stored empty, rinse them several times with clean water, and drain thoroughly. Remove the spigot and bung to promote air flow and store out of sunlight and in a cool (55° – 60°) and optimally humid (65% - 75%) area. An alternative is to fill and store barrels with a sulfur-citric holding solution (recipes are online). This holding solution promotes sanitation and keeps the barrels swelled and smelling sweet however ... it will strip some of the oaks flavors. For your safety and the safety of your family, always follow manufacturers’ guidelines and instructions for the proper use of chemicals. ",

Along with the decal(s) you ordered, you will also find an &quot;It&#39;s Vinyl Y&#39;all&quot; decal in your order because I always include a free decal with my purchases. You can use this as a “tester” to be sure that your decal is applied just right.I’m including some simple instructions below in the event that you haven’t used vinyl before as it is a bit different than a standard sticker. Step 1 Clean the area thoroughly with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. Do not use Windex or similar products because it will leave a residue behind that will prevent the sticker from adhering well. Step 2 Prepare the sticker for application by firmly rubbing a squeegee or credit card across the “top” transfer tape. This removes any air bubbles that may have formed and makes the sticker cling to the transfer tape. Step 3 Peel the white paper “back” backing off the sticker. If the sticker clings to the backing, slowly replace the paper backing and repeat Step 2. Step 4 Slowly lower the sticker onto the surface and rub it in place firmly with a squeegee or credit card. Step 5 Slowly peel the “top” clear transfer tape off at an angle. Be careful not to pull the sticker off the surface. If sticker pulls away from the surface repeat Step 4. **if you are satisfied with your purchase please give positive feedback on my store page. ",

        title: "Handcrafted &#39;Explorer 3&#39; Leather Notebook Cover Organiser - For Midori Traveler&#39;s 11x21cm - Honey Whiskey Tan & Brass",
        description: "The ‘Explorer 3’ Leather Traveler&#39;s Notebook Cover Organiser is the perfect portable solution to the storage and organisation of multiple notebooks ... Main Features: - To fit Midori Traveler&#39;s 11x21cm refill notebooks (not included). - Can accommodate up to 4 notebook refills with each held in place on their own elastic loop. - A highly adaptable organiser and notebook storage solution for travel, work or leisure. - Handcrafted from thick 2.5 - 3.0mm (approx.) full-grain vegetable-tanned shoulder leather that is both flexible yet durable. - Smooth hand-burnished edges for ultimate luxury, comfort and durability. - Strong continuous elastic loop retention system to hold notebooks. - Unique leather tab design feature with high-quality solid brass double cap rivets. - Horizontal &#39;bungee cord&#39; elastic closure and pen holder. - Leather cord page marker with knotted end for adding your own beads, pendants or embellishments. - The leather and the brass rivets will develop a patina over time to look even better with age. - Handmade in England by Fenner. - Stamped on the back with the Fenner CRAFTS logo. NOTE: The pictured notebook refills and pen are for illustration and are not supplied with the cover. Description: Designed to be used as a notebook cover and organiser for the most popular brands and sizes of cahier / side-stapled style notebooks and refills, these leather covers are handcrafted from thick 2.5 - 3.0mm (approx.) full-grain vegetable-tanned shoulder leather for superior durability. A robust and highly customisable notebook cover / organiser system, the Fenner CRAFTS &#39;Explorer 3&#39; notebook cover is the ideal product to use while travelling, on business or pursuing leisure activities. This cover is infinitely alterable with the ability to hold up to 4 separate notebooks at once. You can also add your own features, decoration and accessories onto the adaptable elastic loop retention system. The continuous elastic loop enables organisation of your notebooks, paper notes and printed documents with the unique double-rivited leather tab feature facilitating the tightening of the elastic loops by simply adding another knot inside if required. The leather tab which can be folded flat is also great for grabbing when removing the cover from a shelf or from within a bag. The horizontal elastic loop closure is made from durable &#39;bungee cord&#39; that as well as keeping the cover closed, can also be used for containing all of your loose notes and pens. A leather cord page marker with a knotted end is included and can be customised with your own beads, pendants or embellishments as you wish. The A5 and A4 sizes are ideal for using as storage for your own printed literature (A4 or A3 paper folded in half) and reference notes such as charts, conversion graphs, or tables. The &#39;Explorer 3&#39; offers the ultimate adaptability in a notebook cover / organiser, combined with the highest quality materials and traditional craftsmanship alongside a rugged aesthetic. Product Dimensions & Compatibility: Due to the adaptability of the elastic loop retention system, up to 4 separate side-stapled notebooks can be held and it is also easy to store a thicker notebook such as a hardback notebook along with one or two side-stapled refills if preferred. To fit Midori Traveler&#39;s; refill dimensions 11cm x 21cm; cover dimensions 13.4cm x 23.4cm x 3.8cm; Internal cover capacity: 2.8cm. Available Colours / Finishes: This product is available in the following colour(s) of durable cowhide shoulder leather: - Honey Whiskey Tan with solid brass rivets, brown elastic and brown page marker cord. Notes: 1. Product Photography: Unless otherwise stated pictured accessories including refills are shown for illustration purposes only and are not included in the sale. Products may have been photographed in varying lighting conditions such as daylight or under studio lighting therefore the tone may appear slightly different under different lighting conditions. 2. Use & Intended Function: Products are intended only for the use(s) and purpose described and illustrated. Products consisting of or featuring clasps, connectors, rings or shackles are NOT for use where disengagement could result in bodily injury or property damage / loss. 3. Leather: Leather is a natural material and is therefore subject to inevitable variations between pieces. Variation in the leathers colour, irregularities in grain, natural marks, scars and blemishes are normal and are not considered faults. Additionally, small dents, dings and scratches may be present from the tanning and finishing processes and are inherent to the natural and worked nature of leather. As each piece of handcrafted leather is unique the item you receive may therefore subtly differ from the picture(s) shown. 4. Brass & Metal Hardware Patina: Brass hardware is likely to develop a natural green/brown patina with time - if required, this patina can be removed using a jewellery polishing cloth. Hardware of any metal or finish may over time develop patinas as is characteristic to the material.",

If you have any questions regarding this or require an order by a specific date or event please contact me and I will do my best to accommodate your requirements if possible. postage methods... Your order will be sent by the most appropriate method with consideration to its weight and value. Most domestic (UK) orders will be sent by 1st Class post. Customers wishing to have orders sent by Guaranteed Next Day Delivery services can request a quotation however paying for a faster postal service will not change the estimated dispatch date of made-to-order items. International orders are sent by priority airmail and as this is already the fastest service available cannot be expedited. postage / shipping charges ... Please select your country from the drop-down list on each product to see shipping costs for your location. Excluded locations: I am sorry but I am unable to send orders to the following locations; Australia, Italy and New Zealand. information on Import Duty (applicable to orders from outside EU only) ... Please note that all shipments outside of the European Union (EU) may be subject to Import Duty / TAX / VAT which are applied once a shipment reaches your country. I have no control over these charges and am unable to predict what they may be. These charges are the sole responsibility of the customer as the importer and under no circumstances will Fenner CRAFTS be responsible for the payment of these charges. Customs clearance charges and handling fees must be paid for by the importer of the goods. I am not able to offer a refund for returned goods which are returned because the customer wishes to avoid paying any customs duties imposed. When ordering from Fenner CRAFTS outside of the EU, you agree to pay any Import Duty / Tax / VAT which may be imposed by your country&#39;s government. If you refuse to pay any Import Duty / Tax / VAT imposed and thereby prevent delivery of your order you will remain liable for the purchase price of the product(s) and any Import Duty / Tax / VAT or penalty imposed by your government. In addition, items sent overseas may be subject to random checks which may cause associated delays and additional charges. Fenner CRAFTS is not responsible for any delays or charges imposed by your countries government or other agencies.",
            policy_refunds: "returns procedure ... Items that have not been made to a customers specifications can be returned in their original unused condition within 14 calendar days of the receipt of the order. Unless the product can be proved to be faulty, the buyer will be financially responsible for the safe return of any item using an appropriate insured postage service. If you wish to return an item please email me with details of your order including your order number along with the reason for return - you will be contacted and emailed a printable return label with instructions. A refund of the original purchase price excluding any shipping and handling fees will be issued to the same method used for the original payment upon safe receipt of the return. bespoke products and body piercing jewellery ... In compliance with the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000, I cannot accept returns of, or issue refunds on, any item that has been made to a customers specifications or which has been modified at the request of the customer - this is because I am unlikely to be able to resell such items. For reasons of hygiene I am also unable to accept returns of any body piercing jewellery such as earrings. ",
